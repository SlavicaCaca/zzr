# About the blog

Welcome to 'all things feminist' â€“ a blog quite simply devoted to writings on all things feminist!

The content focuses on radical, intersectional feminist issues, relating to global and local histories and politics of women's liberation, as well as of more contemporary pop-culture feminist issues.
